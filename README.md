**Piscine Rust** is an intensive, project-based bootcamp designed to teach the fundamentals of the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Inspired by the 42 Network’s "learn by doing" 
philosophy, this program throws you into real coding challenges from day one — no lectures, no hand-holding, just pure problem-solving.
